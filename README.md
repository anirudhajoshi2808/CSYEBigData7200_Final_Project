# F1 World Championship Analysis and Winner Prediction
# Proposal

This project aims to accomplish F1 2022 race winner using predictions.

# Requirements:

Formula 1 2022 dataset including:

Driver Details Data 

Team Details Data 

Race Details Data 

Points Details Data


# Vision and Goals

The F1 2022 race winner prediction project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the winner of the 2022 Formula One racing season. The project will use historical data from past Formula One seasons to train and test machine learning models, and then use the trained model to predict the winner of the upcoming races.


The project will use AWS S3 to store the data files required for the analysis. The data files will be loaded into EDA using Spark and Scala, which will enable the project team to perform exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing. Once the data has been processed, the team will use AWS Sagemaker to build and train machine learning models.


The project team will use various machine learning algorithms, including to build and train the models. The models will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.


AWS Athena will be used to create interactive data visualizations that will help the project team to analyze the data and communicate their findings. Finally, the project team will use the trained model to predict the winner of the 2022 Formula One racing season.


The project will be divided into several phases, including data collection, data preprocessing, model development, model training and evaluation, and prediction.
The successful completion of the project will provide valuable insights into the factors that determine the winner of the Formula One racing season. The project outcomes will be useful for race enthusiasts, betting companies, and F1 teams.

# Deliverables

Ingestion of Data: Ingesting the data in AWS S3

Exploratory Data Analysis: Using Spark Scala create and clean the data and store the files in AWS S3

Data Visualization: Using the cleaned data available at AWS S3 create and plot visualizations on Streamlit

ML Predictions: Using machine learning algorithms and libraries build models fitting the data and predict F1 winner 2022 leveraging Spark ML and showcase on Streamlit app
